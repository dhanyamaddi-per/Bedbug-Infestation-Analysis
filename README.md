# Bedbug-Infestation-Analysis

This repository presents a data-driven analysis of bedbug infestations in New York City using a real-world dataset. The goal is to uncover trends, identify high-risk areas, and explore potential predictors for re-infestation through statistical and visual analysis.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Bedbug_Reporting_original.csv`: Raw dataset containing historical reports of bedbug infestations.
- `Bedbug_Reporting_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset used for analysis.
- `Bedbug.sql`: SQL queries used for data exploration and statistical summaries.
- `Bedbug.html`: Final interactive report with visual insights.
- `Bedbug.R` : R used for data exploration and statistical summaries.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze historical patterns of bedbug infestations across NYC boroughs.
- Determine key factors contributing to re-infestation.
- Apply statistical methods to explore correlations and trends.
- Visualize findings to support data-driven decision making.

## 🔍 Research Questions
- What are the historical patterns of bedbug infestations across boroughs?
- What factors contribute to re-infestation in residential units?
- Can re-infestations be predicted based on dwelling characteristics?

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Conducted using Excel and R.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visual exploration.
- **Statistical Techniques**:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Linear regression
  - K-Means clustering
- **Visualization Tools**: R (ggplot2), Python (matplotlib, seaborn)

## 📈 Key Findings
- Brooklyn had the highest infestation count, followed by Manhattan.
- Queens experienced the highest re-infestation rates in most months.
- Infestation trends showed seasonal peaks, especially in December.
- Distribution of re-infestation counts was heavily skewed with extreme outliers.
- Data supports targeted interventions based on geographic and temporal patterns.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: R, Python, SQL
- **Software**: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, MySQL
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, seaborn, pandas, sklearn, statsmodels

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Location data (borough, street, coordinates)
- Unit-level infestation, eradication, and re-infestation counts
- Community-level identifiers (Council District, Community Board)
- Temporal variables (filing period dates)

## 📜 References
- NYC Open Data
- ggplot2 & seaborn documentation
- WHO reports on vector-borne diseases
- Academic literature on infestation and urban housing

## 🧠 Insights
This analysis supports informed pest control strategies by providing visibility into when and where bedbug infestations and re-infestations occur. The findings aim to assist communities and policymakers in proactive planning and public health interventions.
